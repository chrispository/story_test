a = gpt5high in codex - one shot. no readme generated.

b = gpt5high in codex. JSON version of prompt - basically one shot. bash shell got caught up at very end on the npm run dev. tiny codex error, no big deal. 

c = opus 4.1 in claude code - one shot. $2.94 nice readme.

natural language prompt:

i want to create a sleek modern website that uses AI to generate a choose your own adventure story for users, with pictures generated by google imagen. let's use google gemini for the storywriting as well. it is very important that there is an admin panel where we are able to adjust basically every parameter possible, and ALL prompts. we also need to be able to tweak how the story prompts are generated for the user. we should have the smallest, easiest database possible to store multiple images for each screen of the story, so that we can switch between landscape and portrait orientations. it should be incredibly minimal, similar to the LLM interfaces of 2025. the less buttons the user sees the better. we'll want a light and dark mode. the opening screen should ask the user what genre they want: military sci fi, space opera, or space tech thriller. we'll definitely want sleek quick animations, it should overall feel futuristic and clean. use gradients tastefully.
